# Nothing Discord Bot

Welcome to the Nothing Discord Bot project! This bot is developed in Python and provides various fun and useful functionalities for your Discord server.

## Start

My journey with Python began with the guidance and motivation of my mentor, Lucknell Madestin, who helped me create my first Python bot. This experience ignited my passion for Python, leading me to develop the Nothing Discord Bot.

## Functionality

Prefix for Commands: `!`

| Command | Function |
| ------- | -------- |
| `!hello` | Prints out a welcome message |
| `!help` | Prints a message listing the functions |
| `!joke` | Prints a random joke from the Postman Joke API in the chat. |
| `!tldr` | Takes a PDF attachment and creates a TLDR (too long didn't read) for it |

## Project Learnings

- **.gitignore & .env**: Utilize `.gitignore` to exclude certain files from being staged and `.env` to hide sensitive information like tokens.
- **JSON Parsing**: Parse JSON output and manipulate it to print specific elements.
- **Organized Command Structure**: Use Cogs to organize commands into different files, making the code easier to read and understand.
- **Gemini API**: Leverage the Gemini API to process text prompts and return custom summaries.

## Future Enhancements

- **Additional Commands**: Implement more interactive and useful commands to enhance the bot's functionality.
- **Improved Summarization**: Refine the TLDR functionality to handle a wider range of document types and provide more accurate summaries.
- **User Interaction**: Develop features that enhance user interaction and engagement with the bot.
