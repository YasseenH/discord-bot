# Nothing Discord Bot

## Start
I learned Python in the past and one of my past mentors, Lucknell Madestin, motivated me and helped me make my first python bot. From there, I later learned more about Python and continued the journey to making this bot.

## Functionality
Prefix for Commands: !

| Command  | Function |
| -------- | -------- |
| !hello  | Prints out a welcome message  |
| !help  | Prints a message listing the functions  |
| !joke  | Prints a random joke from the Postman Joke API in the chat. |

## Learned how to:
Utilize .gitignore to hide certain files from being staged and .env to hide sensitive information (TOKEN)

Parse JSON output and manipulate to print certain elements
