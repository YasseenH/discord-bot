# Nothing Discord Bot

## Start
I learned Python in the past and one of my past mentors, Lucknell Madestin, motivated me and helped me make my first python bot. From there, I later learned more about Python and continued the journey to making this bot.

## Functionality
Prefix for Commmands : !

!hello      Prints out a welcome message
!help       Prints a message listing the functions


## Learned how to:
Utilize .gitignore to hide certain files from being staged and .env to hide sensitive information (TOKEN)
