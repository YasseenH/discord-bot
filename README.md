# Nothing Discord Bot

## Start
I learned Python in the past and one of my mentors, Lucknell Madestin, motivated me and helped me make my first python bot. From there, I later learned more about Python and continued the journey to making this bot.

## Functionality
Prefix for Commands: !

| Command  | Function |
| -------- | -------- |
| !hello  | Prints out a welcome message  |
| !help  | Prints a message listing the functions  |
| !joke  | Prints a random joke from the Postman Joke API in the chat. |
| !tldr  | Takes a PDF attachment and creates a TLDR (too long didn't read) for it |

## Learned how to:
Utilize .gitignore to hide certain files from being staged and .env to hide sensitive information (TOKEN)

Parse JSON output and manipulate to print certain elements

Organize my commands in different files using Cogs making it easier to read/understand
